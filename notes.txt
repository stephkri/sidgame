States for:
- Player score
- ???

Story:
- Screen presents two buttons to pick from: Sid Hoffman, or Sid Frenchman
- Player clicks one of the two buttons (let's say Sid Hoffman is false, and Sid Frenchman is true)
- A random boolean is generated and cross-referenced with the player's choice
- This boolean also determines which name will be displayed in the next component
- One of the props in this component will be whether or not the boolean matches up with the player's choice
- Depending on that, it'll either say "Sorry, try again" or "you gained a point"

The player's score will be in another component, with an option to reset the score

Visual modes needed by the main component:
- Two buttons to select from
- Result and score announcement

Possible bonus idea: if Math.random is exactly 0, display "Sid Hoff...frenchman"


Pseudocode:
Perhaps have selection and result as states, both initially set to an empty string
onClick = set selection to either Hoffman or Frenchman, and set result to generateSid()
Then toggle mode to view result
If result === selection, then increase score, else either leave it be or decrease it
Next button in result: reset both selection and result, and toggle mode back to Buttons
